Google Homepage - The Odin Project
Objective - Recreate the Google homepage using HTML and CSS.

Reflection - I've learned a lot about Flexbox and Grid and positioning with CSS. I struggled a lot with nested grids and unorganized constraints.
Note to future Kamilka - Use comments as if a stranger is reading your code, plan grids and constraints on paper first, use Prettier, and comment changes to constraints.
